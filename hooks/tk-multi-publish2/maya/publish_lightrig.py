        property will be presented to this method.

        A publish task will be generated for each item accepted here.

        * ``accepted``: Indicates if the plugin is interested in this value at all.
          If ``False``, no task will be created for this plugin. Required.
        * ``enabled``: If ``True``, the created task will be enabled in the UI,
          otherwise it will be disabled (no interaction allowed). Optional,
          ``True`` by default.
        * ``visible``: If ``True``, the created task will be visible in the UI,
          otherwise it will be hidden. Optional, ``True`` by default.
        * ``checked``: If ``True``, the created task will be checked in the UI,
          otherwise it will be unchecked. Optional, ``True`` by default.

        In addition to the item, the configured settings for this plugin are
        supplied. The information provided by each of these arguments can be
        used to decide whether to accept the item.

        For example, the item's ``properties`` :class:`dict` may house meta data
        about the item, populated during collection. This data can be used to
        inform the acceptance logic.
