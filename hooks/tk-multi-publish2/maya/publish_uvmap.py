        * ``default``: The default value for the settings. This can be ``None``.
        * ``description``: A description of the setting as a string.

        The values configured for the plugin will be supplied via settings
        parameter in the :meth:`accept`, :meth:`validate`, :meth:`publish`, and
        :meth:`finalize` methods.

        The values also drive the custom UI defined by the plugin whick allows
        artists to manipulate the settings at runtime. See the
        :meth:`create_settings_widget`, :meth:`set_ui_settings`, and
        :meth:`get_ui_settings` for additional information.

        * ``enabled``: If ``True``, the created task will be enabled in the UI,
          otherwise it will be disabled (no interaction allowed). Optional,
          ``True`` by default.
        * ``visible``: If ``True``, the created task will be visible in the UI,
          otherwise it will be hidden. Optional, ``True`` by default.
        * ``checked``: If ``True``, the created task will be checked in the UI,
          otherwise it will be unchecked. Optional, ``True`` by default.

        supplied. The information provided by each of these arguments can be
        used to decide whether to accept the item.
